		<p>Lake Merritt is the oldest wildlife refuge in the United States. There are numerous birds at Lake Merritt, some year-round residents, and some migratory birds passing through. Because Lake Merritt is actually a tidal slough, it has brackish water and attracts a variety of shorebirds and seabirds.</p>

		<p>The most (in)famous birds are the Canada Geese. Although the geese are normally migratory, there is a smaller population of them that are year-round residents. The most beloved bird would probably be Hank the pelican, an injured bird that is a permanent resident.</P>
